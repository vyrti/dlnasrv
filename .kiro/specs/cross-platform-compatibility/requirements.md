# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to make the OpenDLNA server fully cross-platform compatible, ensuring it works reliably on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems without requiring special privileges or configuration. The current implementation works well on macOS but has several Windows compatibility issues related to networking, file handling, and build processes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Windows user, I want to run the DLNA server without administrator privileges, so that I can easily use the application in corporate or restricted environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts on Windows THEN it SHALL bind to SSDP multicast without requiring administrator privileges
2. IF port 1900 is unavailable THEN the system SHALL automatically select an alternative port and announce it properly
3. WHEN running on Windows THEN the system SHALL detect and handle Windows Firewall restrictions gracefully
4. WHEN multicast fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to unicast discovery methods

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer on any platform, I want consistent build processes, so that I can compile and distribute the application regardless of my operating system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building on Windows THEN the system SHALL provide PowerShell build scripts equivalent to bash scripts
2. WHEN cross-compiling THEN the system SHALL handle Windows-specific linker requirements automatically
3. WHEN packaging THEN the system SHALL create platform-appropriate installers (MSI for Windows, PKG for macOS, DEB/RPM for Linux)
4. WHEN using CI/CD THEN the system SHALL build and test on all target platforms automatically

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user on any operating system, I want reliable network discovery, so that DLNA clients can find my media server consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the SSDP service THEN the system SHALL detect the best network interface automatically on each platform
2. WHEN multiple network interfaces exist THEN the system SHALL announce on all appropriate interfaces
3. WHEN network configuration changes THEN the system SHALL adapt SSDP announcements accordingly
4. WHEN behind NAT or VPN THEN the system SHALL still be discoverable on the local network
5. WHEN Windows has strict multicast policies THEN the system SHALL use alternative discovery methods

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with media files on any file system, I want consistent file access, so that the server works with Windows NTFS, macOS APFS, and Linux ext4 equally well.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning media directories THEN the system SHALL handle case-insensitive file systems (Windows) and case-sensitive file systems (Linux) correctly
2. WHEN serving files THEN the system SHALL handle Windows drive letters and Unix absolute paths transparently
3. WHEN encountering file permission issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages specific to each platform
4. WHEN dealing with special characters in filenames THEN the system SHALL handle platform-specific encoding differences
5. WHEN accessing network drives THEN the system SHALL work with UNC paths on Windows and mounted filesystems on Unix

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper logging and diagnostics, so that I can troubleshoot platform-specific issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL log platform-specific diagnostic information
2. WHEN file access fails THEN the system SHALL provide platform-appropriate error messages and suggestions
3. WHEN SSDP fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed network interface and multicast information
4. WHEN running in debug mode THEN the system SHALL show platform-specific configuration details
5. WHEN startup fails THEN the system SHALL provide platform-specific troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an end user, I want simple installation and configuration, so that I can set up the DLNA server without technical expertise on any platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing on Windows THEN the system SHALL provide an MSI installer with proper Windows integration
2. WHEN installing on macOS THEN the system SHALL provide a signed PKG installer or Homebrew formula
3. WHEN installing on Linux THEN the system SHALL provide DEB and RPM packages for major distributions
4. WHEN first running THEN the system SHALL auto-detect optimal configuration for the current platform
5. WHEN configuration is needed THEN the system SHALL provide platform-appropriate configuration tools

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer contributing to the project, I want consistent development environments, so that I can develop and test cross-platform features effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up development THEN the system SHALL provide Docker-based development environments for all platforms
2. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL execute platform-specific test suites automatically
3. WHEN debugging network issues THEN the system SHALL provide platform-specific debugging tools and commands
4. WHEN validating builds THEN the system SHALL test on virtual machines or containers for each target platform
5. WHEN documenting THEN the system SHALL include platform-specific setup and troubleshooting guides

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to remember my media files and detect new ones automatically, so that I don't have to wait for full rescans every time I start the server or add new media.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL load previously scanned media information from a portable database
2. WHEN scanning media directories THEN the system SHALL store file metadata, paths, and media information in a SQLite database
3. WHEN new files are added to monitored directories THEN the system SHALL detect them automatically using file system events
4. WHEN files are removed from monitored directories THEN the system SHALL update the database to reflect the changes
5. WHEN the database becomes corrupted THEN the system SHALL rebuild it automatically from a fresh scan
6. WHEN starting up THEN the system SHALL perform incremental updates rather than full rescans of existing directories

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure monitored directories and network settings through a configuration file, so that I can customize the server behavior without recompiling the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL read configuration from a platform-appropriate configuration file
2. WHEN the configuration file doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create one with sensible defaults
3. WHEN I modify the configuration file THEN the system SHALL detect changes and reload settings without restart
4. WHEN configuring monitored directories THEN I SHALL be able to specify multiple paths with individual settings
5. WHEN configuring network settings THEN I SHALL be able to select specific network interfaces or use automatic detection
6. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fall back to defaults

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want the application to follow platform security best practices, so that it doesn't compromise my system's security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on Windows THEN the system SHALL integrate with Windows Defender and firewall appropriately
2. WHEN running on macOS THEN the system SHALL request appropriate permissions through the system dialog
3. WHEN running on Linux THEN the system SHALL work with SELinux and AppArmor policies
4. WHEN binding to network ports THEN the system SHALL use the minimum required privileges on each platform
5. WHEN accessing files THEN the system SHALL respect platform-specific access controls and sandboxing
